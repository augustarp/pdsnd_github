### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project,we make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington by using code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We also have a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also. You will need the three city dataset files too: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.
